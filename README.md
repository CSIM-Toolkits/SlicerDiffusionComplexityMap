# Slicer Diffusion Complexity Map

Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) are well-known and powerful imaging techniques in MRI. For DTI images, the most used measurements are the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). However, the limitations of FA and ADC formalism are also vastly debated due to low tissue contrast for ADC maps and measurement artifacts present in crossing-fiber orientation for FA maps. Although the DTI evaluation has evolved continually in recent years, there are still struggles regarding the quantitative measurement that can benefit brain areas that are consistently difficult to measure on diffusion-based methods, e.g., the grey matter (GM). The present Slicer extension proposes offer an image processing technique using the principle of diffusion distribution evaluation regarding the LMC complexity measure, named Diffusion Complexity (DC).
